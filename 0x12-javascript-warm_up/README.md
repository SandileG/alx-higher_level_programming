# JavaScript Basics

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript programming. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, you'll find everything you need to know about JavaScript in this README.

# Why JavaScript programming is amazing

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the web. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive websites, web applications, and server-side applications. With its widespread adoption, rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, and constant evolution, JavaScript offers endless possibilities for developers to build innovative solutions.

# How to run a JavaScript script

To run a JavaScript script, you can use a web browser's developer console, Node.js runtime environment, or embed JavaScript code directly within an HTML document. For web development, you can include JavaScript files using <script> tags in your HTML file.

# How to create variables and constants

In JavaScript, you can create variables using the var, let, or const keywords. Variables declared with var and let can be reassigned, while variables declared with const are constants and cannot be reassigned.

# Differences between var, const, and let

* var: Function-scoped variable declaration, can be reassigned and updated.
* let: Block-scoped variable declaration, can be reassigned but not updated outside its block scope.
* const: Block-scoped constant declaration, cannot be reassigned or updated.

# Data types available in JavaScript

JavaScript supports various data types, including:

* Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
* Non-primitive types: object, function

# How to use if, if ... else statements

Conditional statements such as if, if...else, and else if allow you to execute code conditionally based on specified conditions.

# How to use comments

JavaScript supports single-line comments using // and multi-line comments using /* */ syntax.

# How to assign values to variables

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =. For example, let x = 10;.

# How to use while and for loops

JavaScript provides while and for loops for iterative execution of code.

Example:

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

# How to use break and continue statements

The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

# What is a function and how to use functions

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions in JavaScript can be declared using the function keyword or using arrow function syntax (() => {}).

# What does a function that does not use any return statement return

A function that does not use any return statement implicitly returns undefined.

# Scope of variables

Variables in JavaScript have function scope when declared with var and block scope when declared with let or const. Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function (local scope), while variables declared outside any function are accessible globally (global scope).

# Arithmetic operators and how to use them

JavaScript supports various arithmetic operators, including +, -, *, /, %, ++, and --, for performing arithmetic operations on numerical values.

# How to manipulate dictionary

In JavaScript, you can manipulate dictionary-like objects known as Objects. You can add, modify, or delete properties of an object using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).

# How to import a file

In JavaScript, you can import code from other files using the import statement (ES6 module syntax) or using Node.js's require() function (CommonJS syntax). However, in browser-based JavaScript, importing files directly is not possible without the use of a module bundler like Webpack.
