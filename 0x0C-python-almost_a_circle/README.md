# Python Higher Level Programming Prep

Unit Testing:

Description: Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they function as intended.
Implementation in a Large Project: In a large project, organize tests into separate suites, focus on testing individual functions or methods, and use testing frameworks like JUnit (for Java), pytest (for Python), etc.


# Serialization and Deserialization of a Class:

Description: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format (e.g., JSON, XML) that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the serialized data back into an object.
Implementation: Use libraries like Gson (Java), JSON.NET (C#), or json (Python) to serialize an object to a string and deserialize it back.

# Writing and Reading a JSON File:

Description: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. Writing to a JSON file involves converting data to JSON format and saving it, while reading involves loading JSON data from a file.
Implementation: Use libraries like Jackson (Java), Newtonsoft.Json (C#), or json (Python) to handle JSON operations.

# * args in Python:

Description: *args is a special syntax in Python that allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. It collects them into a tuple, providing flexibility in function calls.
Usage: def example_function(*args): allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments.

# ** kwargs in Python:

Description: **kwargs is similar to *args but for keyword arguments. It allows a function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments, collecting them into a dictionary.
Usage: def example_function(**kwargs): enables the function to accept any number of keyword arguments.

# Handling Named Arguments in a Function:

Description: Named arguments are passed to a function with a specific name, making the code more readable and allowing parameters to be passed in any order.
Handling: Define function parameters with names, and when calling the function, provide values with corresponding parameter names, like function_name(param1=value1, param2=value2).
